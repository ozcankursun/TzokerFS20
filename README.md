# Assignment
You are assigned to create the results page for the Tzoker lottery (https://tzoker.opap.gr/en). Tzoker combines two lotteries: draw 5 numbers from a pool of 45 numbers (1-45) and then draw an extra number from a different pool of 20 numbers (1-20). You should make two tables, displaying the numbers of these two pools. You should mark the winning numbers on these tables. You should also write the winning numbers in their own section. Here are the specs:
1. Add a header for the page, a brief description (containg a link to the Tzoker page), a table 9x5 (9 rows, 5 columns) for the first pool, a table 5x4 for the second pool. Fill the table with the numbers.
1. The first table should have the title "Draw", the second "Tzoker number" (titles are headers).
1. In both tables, odd numbers should be displayed in one color, even numbers in another. All numbers should be centered in the cell.
1. The tables should have no lines (tip #1). 
1. The numbers should be inside a circular background (tip #2).
1. Numbers should be written in a dark color on a light background. Use different colors each table.
1. Winning numbers in the first pool should be a light color on a dark silver background; on the second use light color on a gold background.
1. The winning numbers, on both tables, should have a visible thin red border.
1. Below the second table write the winning numbers only. See the "Last Draw" box in the Tzoker page and immitate this box, using your color palette.
1. Change the color of the link according to your palette
1. Add a favicon

## Steps
1. First of all create the Github repository (public) and then clone it in your computer.
1. Try toollow the steps, in their order. This is not a strict directive; you may use your own path. But ...
    1. you should try to *finish a step before move to the other*.
1. After you commplete a step, test it. If there are problems, debug. If you are successful, commit using an appropriate message (ie *Remove table border* or *Add favicon*).
1. This is a single page so you could use internal stylesheet. Please use an *external* one, isntead.
1. Your page should have a title and a background color. First thing is to select your color palette.

## Tips
1. The table always has a border. The point is to hide it.
2. The border defines the area (eg when you define the background color, you fill the are inside the border). So you should shape the border.
